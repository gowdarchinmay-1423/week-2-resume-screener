# Resume Screener - Week 2

## Overview
This is the Week 2 version of the Resume Screener project.  
Improvements from Week 1:
- Improved Streamlit layout
- Added predicted category display (ML model placeholders)
- Enhanced text extraction and error handling

**Note:** Large ML model files (`.pkl`) are **not included in this repo** due to GitHub size restrictions. Add them locally to run the predictions.

## Features
- Upload PDF, DOCX, TXT resumes
- Extract text and show it in the app
- Display predicted category (requires ML model files locally)

## Files
- `app.py` – Main Streamlit app
- `README.md` – Project description
- `reqiurements.txt` – Required Python packages
- `.gitignore` – Ignore `.pkl` files

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r reqiurements.txt




streamlit run app.py
